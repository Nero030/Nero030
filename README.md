### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I live in Korea and major in Bio Medical Engineering. (+ Bio AI)
I'm currently studying Python for data science, deep learning... and Auto CAD (although CAD is a little far from coding...), 
and I'm planning to learn JAVA, C++ and more diverse languages. 
I look forward to your kind cooperation. ðŸ˜„
